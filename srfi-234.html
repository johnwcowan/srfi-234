<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>
Topological sorting is an algorithm that takes a graph consisting of
nodes and other nodes that depend on them, forming a partial order,
and returns a list representing a total ordering of the graph.
If the graph is cyclic, the topological sort will fail, and an
error will be signaled.
</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

<p>Consider the following graph representing steps to be performed:</p>

<img src="Directed_acyclic_graph_2.svg">

<p>This graph means that (among other things) steps 5 and 7 must be
performed before step 11, and step 11 must be performed before steps 2, 9,
and 10.  By topologically sorting this graph, we get one possible total
ordering of the steps that satisfies the partial order.</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p><code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph</em><code>)</code><br>
<code>(topological-sort </code><em>graph comparator</em><code>)</code></p>
<p>Topologically sorts <em>graph</em>,
which is a list of connections.  Each connection is a list of the form
<code>(</code><em>node dependency dependency</em> ...<code>)</code>,
meaning that <em>dependencies</em> are dependent on <em>node</em>.
The optional argument <em>comparator</em> specifies the identity relation
between nodes; it defaults to <code>eqv-comparator</code>.</p>
<p>If the same node (in the sense of <em>comparator</em>) appears
in the car of more than one connection, the connections are merged.<p>
<p>If <em>graph</em> is circular, <code>#f</code> is returned.</p>
<p>The graph shown above can be represented as
<code>((5 11) (7 11 8) (3 8 10) (11 2 9 10) (8 9))</code>,
or as a list of edges: <code>((5 11) (7 11) (7 8) (3 8) (3 10)
(11 2) (11 9) (11 10) (8 9))</code>.
One possible result of applying `topological-sort` to this graph
is the list <code>(3 7 5 11 2 8 10 9)</code>, meaning that
performing steps 3, 7, 5, ..., 10, 9 in that order will satisfy
the partial ordering of the graph.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The sample implementation is available in the SRFI 234 repository.</p>
<p>Several other variant implementations are available: one by Shiro Kawai, written
for Gauche; one for SLIB; and a modified version of the first by Arvydas Silanskas.</p>
